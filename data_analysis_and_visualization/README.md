# Data analysis and visualization

This folder contains code to **process, visualize and analyse** the raw tests results of the load and performance tests. Each testscript has a folder with two files:

| File                | Function                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `processRawData.js` | Process the raw test result data         |
| `graphs.ipynb`      | Visualize and analyse the processed data |
