# Performance testing

These tests were written to measure the impact of cybersecurity best practices on the performance of both the REST API and the front-end webapplication. Each folder contains a testscript with instructions to run it. 

| Folder | Application | Contents |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| load_testing_api | [Web Services REST API](https://github.com/jorenvermeersch-hogent/bachelorproef-backend) | Load tests with Artillery CLI. |
| performance_testing_frontend | [Front-end Web Development React application](https://github.com/jorenvermeersch-hogent/bachelorproef-backend) | Performance tests with Google Lighthouse. |

**Note**: The 'Application' column contains links to the repostory of each application.
